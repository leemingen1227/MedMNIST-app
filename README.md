# Objective
Deploy the model trained on the medical images from the MedMNIST dataset on the website. Users can choose to input a single image to generate prediction results, or upload test data files to calculate the Accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the model. The website is also deployed on AWS EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk through Docker.
